/**
 * UNIT TESTS — chat widget contact-form delivery honesty
 * client/src/components/AIChatWidget.tsx
 *
 * Before this fix: confirming the reviewed message at the `form_done` stage
 * ran `handleForm`'s synchronous "yes" branch, which unconditionally
 * rendered "Done! ✅ Your message has been sent to the AGL team. They'll
 * reach out to you at ${email} within 1 business day." — with NO network
 * call anywhere in the file (`grep -nE "fetch\(|trpc\.|axios|XMLHttpRequest|
 * web3forms"` over the pre-fix file returns no matches). Every visitor who
 * confirmed sending a message was given a specific, false delivery
 * confirmation while their inquiry was silently discarded.
 *
 * The fix reuses client/src/pages/Contact.tsx's own working pattern: POST to
 * https://api.web3forms.com/submit with the same WEB3FORMS_KEY, read
 * `data.success`, and only then report success — otherwise throw and show an
 * honest failure with a route that works (contact@americangroup.ai, /contact).
 *
 * Each test below fails against the pre-fix copy (no fetch call is ever
 * made; success renders unconditionally and instantly; a failed/rejected
 * request still claims success) and passes against the corrected version.
 * Real timers are used (RESPONSE_DELAY_MS is a flat 500ms — see
 * ai-chat-widget-honesty.test.tsx for why), so no fake-timer/async race.
